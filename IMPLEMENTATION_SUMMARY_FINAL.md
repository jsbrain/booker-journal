# Implementation Summary: Fixed System Architecture

## What Was Changed

The Booker Journal system has been restructured from a project-based inventory model to a **global business inventory model** that matches your requirements.

## The Problem

Previously, inventory purchases were tied to specific projects (customers), which didn't match the real business flow where:
- You (the admin) buy inventory globally
- You sell products from your global inventory to various customers
- Different purchase prices over time should affect profit calculations

## The Solution

### Database Changes
- **inventory_purchases table**: Changed from `project_id` (customer-specific) to `user_id` (global to admin)
- This makes all inventory purchases global, not tied to any specific customer
- Sales to customers now deduct from the global inventory pool

### Updated Components
1. **Server Actions** (`lib/actions/`)
   - `inventory.ts`: Purchases are now global, no projectId needed
   - `metrics.ts`: Uses weighted average of ALL inventory purchases for COGS
   
2. **UI Components** (`components/`)
   - `CreateInventoryPurchaseDialog`: No longer requires selecting a customer
   - `InventoryList`: Shows global inventory across all customers
   
3. **Validation** (`lib/db/validation.ts`)
   - Updated schemas to remove projectId from inventory operations

4. **Seed Data** (`lib/db/seed-data.ts`)
   - Creates global inventory purchases for the admin user

## How It Works Now

### Example Flow (From Your Issue)

1. **Buy Inventory Globally**
   ```
   Date: 01.01.2025
   Action: Buy 100 Blumen for €5 each
   Total Cost: €500
   → Added to global inventory
   ```

2. **Create Customer**
   ```
   Customer Name: custA
   → Creates a new project
   ```

3. **Make Sales to Customer**
   ```
   Sale 1: 10.01.2025 - 10 Blumen @ €10 = €100 revenue
   Sale 2: 10.02.2025 - 20 Blumen @ €12 = €240 revenue
   Sale 3: 01.03.2025 - 20 Blumen @ €8 = €160 revenue
   
   Total: 50 Blumen sold
   ```

4. **System Calculates**
   ```
   Revenue: €100 + €240 + €160 = €500
   Cost (COGS): 50 units × €5/unit = €250
   Profit: €500 - €250 = €250
   
   Inventory Remaining: 100 - 50 = 50 Blumen
   Customer Owes: €500 (until they pay)
   ```

5. **Buy More Inventory at Different Price**
   ```
   Date: 01.06.2025
   Action: Buy 50 Blumen for €3 each
   Total Cost: €150
   
   New Weighted Average:
   - Total: 150 units (100 + 50)
   - Total Cost: €650 (€500 + €150)
   - Avg Price: €4.33/unit
   ```

6. **Make Same Sales Again**
   ```
   Revenue: €500 (same)
   Cost (COGS): 50 × €4.33 = €216.50 (LOWER!)
   Profit: €500 - €216.50 = €283.50 (HIGHER!)
   
   ✅ The lower purchase price is reflected in higher profit!
   ```

## What You Can Do Now

### In the Admin Panel (`/dashboard/admin`)
- ✅ Create and manage products (Blumen, Pfannen, Schokolade, etc.)
- ✅ Set default buying prices for products

### In the Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Projects Tab**: See all your customers and their balances
- **Inventory Tab**: 
  - ✅ Add inventory purchases (global, not customer-specific)
  - ✅ View current stock levels (purchased - sold across all customers)
  - ✅ See purchase history
  - ✅ Monitor inventory value

### In Customer Pages (`/dashboard/projects/[id]`)
- **Entries Tab**: Make sales, record payments
- **Metrics Tab**: 
  - ✅ See customer's revenue, cost, and profit
  - ✅ Product-level breakdown
  - ✅ Filter by date range
  - ✅ Compare different time periods

## Database Migration

### If Starting Fresh
```bash
bun run db:push
```
This creates all tables with the new structure.

### If You Have Existing Data

**CRITICAL**: The migration renames `project_id` to `user_id`. You must migrate the data BEFORE the column rename happens.

#### Step 1: Migrate the Data (BEFORE applying migration)
Run this SQL to update the values while the column is still named `project_id`:

```sql
-- This updates project_id values to point to user_id BEFORE the column rename
UPDATE inventory_purchases ip
SET project_id = (
  SELECT p.user_id 
  FROM projects p 
  WHERE p.id = ip.project_id
);
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Schema Migration
Now apply the migration which will rename `project_id` to `user_id`:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

**Important**: If you apply the migration first, the column will be renamed and you won't be able to run the data migration query above. Always do Step 1 before Step 2.

See `MIGRATION_0001.md` for detailed migration steps and rollback instructions.

## Files Changed

### Core Files
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Updated inventory_purchases table structure
- `lib/db/validation.ts` - Updated validation schemas
- `lib/actions/inventory.ts` - Removed projectId, added global inventory functions
- `lib/actions/metrics.ts` - Uses global inventory for COGS calculations
- `lib/db/seed-data.ts` - Seeds global inventory instead of per-project

### UI Files
- `components/create-inventory-purchase-dialog.tsx` - No longer needs projectId
- `components/inventory-list.tsx` - Shows global inventory
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use global inventory

### Documentation
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system overview
- `MIGRATION_0001.md` - Migration guide
- `drizzle/0001_update_inventory_to_global.sql` - Migration SQL

## All Requirements Met ✅

From the original GitHub issue "Fix the whole system" (#[issue-number]):
- ✅ Admin can create products in admin panel
- ✅ Admin buys inventory globally (not per customer)
- ✅ Inventory is tracked: purchases - sales across all customers
- ✅ Can create customers (projects)
- ✅ Can make sales to customers with products
- ✅ System shows:
  - ✅ Current revenue (what customer sales total)
  - ✅ What customer owes (outstanding balance)
  - ✅ Potential profit (revenue - cost based on purchase prices)
  - ✅ Current inventory (purchased - sold)
  - ✅ All dates and values
- ✅ Different purchase prices over time affect profit correctly (weighted average)

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration (see instructions above)
2. Test the flow:
   - Create some products
   - Add global inventory purchases
   - Create customer projects
   - Make sales to customers
   - View metrics and inventory
3. Everything should work as described in your issue!
